**A web app where users can:**
1. Paste a YouTube video link.
2. Control playback speed and loop sections with hotkeys.
3. Display Japanese (or any target language) transcriptions (auto-generated or pulled from subtitles).
4. Translate each line into English (or native language).
5. Build flashcards from the sentences.
<br>

_Currently can link YouTube videos, control playback speed with hotkeys, **and loop at any point in the video!**._ 
<br>
- Loop features:
  - Toggle loop on to enable a 5 second loop from where it was toggled
  - Click the +-5s buttons to change the start & end times of the loop (or simply scrub throught the timeline or even use keyboard seeking hotkeys)
  - Change the loop duration with +-1s start/end buttons (i.e., change start/end from: start: 5s end: 10s to something like start: 8s end 11s) (get specific with parts you want to practice!)
<br>

**Working on:**
- _Displaying target language transcriptions._
- _Translating target language to native language._
- _Building flashcards from each sentence._
